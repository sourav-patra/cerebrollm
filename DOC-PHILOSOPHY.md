# Documentation philosophy

This file sets how documents in this repository are written and organised. It applies to READMEs, specs, plans, design records, handovers, runbooks and agent instruction files.

## What a document is for

A document exists so a reader can act. A new reader should finish the entry page able to say what the project does, who it is for, what goes in, what comes out and what decision the output supports. Every other document earns its place by serving one task that reader has, or by being a reference the entry page points to.

## Before writing

Ask, in order, and stop at the first yes: does this document need to exist; does an existing document already cover it; can a pointer to that document replace it; can it be one line in an existing file. Only then write a new file. Read the code, config and existing records the document describes before describing them; a document that restates what a config file or a help command already says goes stale and is deleted. Prevent leaking any persona names (including owner's), references to owner's system paths, etc

## Four kinds

Every file is one kind, and the kind sets its folder, its name and its shape.

| Kind | Purpose | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| Contract | A rule or design the project is held to: spec, design record, policy, this file | Goal, requirements with an ID, a check and an evidence location, out of scope, order of work |
| Record | What happened and what is true now: handover, state note, lessons | One dated line per fact; under 16 KB |
| Receipt | Proof a check ran: logs, hashes, acceptance rows | Machine format with one plain-text line at the top saying what it proves |
| Message | A request or answer to one recipient | ID, kind, sender, recipient, the one question or action, evidence locations |

## Names and the index

Files are named `<KIND>-<subject>-<YYYY-MM-DD>[-r<n>].md`: kind in capitals, subject in lowercase with hyphens, ISO date only, a revision suffix only when the file replaces an earlier one. The replaced file moves to `archive/` the same day. `INDEX.md` at the project root lists the current file of each kind with its path and a hash prefix; a file not in the index is not current, and a reader starts at the index.

## Writing rules

1. The first line is what the reader does next, or the one fact that decides it.
2. One meaning lives in one place; everywhere else points to it.
3. Multi-step work is numbered, one bounded action per step, the fewest steps that work, each ending on a check the reader can run.
4. Numbers are measured or marked not measured, with the command that would measure them.
5. Claims name their source, and the text keeps observed, reported, proposed and unmeasured distinct.
6. Plain technical language: named actors, terms defined at first use, errors stated as cause and fix, no openers that announce the content, no closers that recap it, no emphasis formatting, no figurative phrasing.
7. Every document ends with one line naming what was skipped or not checked.
8. Secrets, tokens, personal data and paths outside the project never appear.
9. Size limits: record 16 KB, contract 24 KB, index 2 KB. Over the limit means split or archive, with a summary at the top of the kept file.
10. Files read by automated agents put steps before reference, push reference the agent needs only sometimes behind a pointer, and state the wanted behaviour rather than the forbidden one.

## Visual explanations

Check whether a visual would make the reader's task easier before completing an explanatory document. Include a diagram when prose makes relationships, movement, boundaries, branching, or change hard to follow. Use a table for attributes, a plot for measured quantities, and a sentence when that is sufficient. There is no minimum figure count.

Each figure answers one reader question and sits beside the explanation that uses it. Use the same names as the text, meaningful alternative text, and a caption explaining the conclusion and limits. Label planned behavior and omitted paths. Keep views small enough to follow; move detail into a separate view when necessary. Labels and shapes must carry meaning without relying on color alone.

For documentation diagrams, maintain a plain-text SVG in the repository as the sole editable source and edit it directly. Keep third-party diagram authoring tool names and tool-specific source, metadata, configuration, installation steps, and commands out of repository files, commit messages, and pull request and issue text. A tool the project genuinely depends on at runtime or in its build is exempt. Maintain no parallel diagram-language, HTML, or external regeneration source. Use system fonts and no external font or resource requests. If the reading surface requires PNG, render it from the maintained SVG and update the derived image whenever the SVG changes. Readers must be able to view the figure without authoring tools or external scripts.

Check depicted facts against the relevant source revision, then inspect the rendered result at its intended size for readable text, correct arrows, clear boundaries, clipping, overlap, and contrast. Record what ran and what was visually inspected; an unperformed check stays pending. For figures on entry pages or primary task paths, ask a reader who did not author the document to explain the depicted relationships and limits without coaching; record their answer and any misunderstanding before revising the figure. For other figures, a reader check is recommended; record it as not run when it is omitted. An overhaul follows its agreed reader acceptance check. Illustrations do not establish measured benefit or replace the checks supporting a claim.

## Checks

A lint runs before every commit and fails on: a filename date in any other format, spaces in a filename, dashes joining clauses in prose, filler and promotional words, a file over its size limit, a missing or stale index entry, a record line that does not match the record shape. The lint supplements a human edit for clarity; it does not replace it. A document change ships with the same evidence as a code change: the check that ran and its result.

Checksum: [DOC-PHILOSOPHY.md.sha256](DOC-PHILOSOPHY.md.sha256). The sidecar records the SHA-256 of this complete file.

Skipped or not checked: nothing in this file is project-specific; each project supplies its own index and lint configuration.
